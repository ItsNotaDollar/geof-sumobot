# **Sumobot - THE Code**

### Program Overview
For the 2017 addvanced competition we used QRDs for white line sensors and 2 ultrasonic sensors for locating our opponent.

### Sensors
#### QRDs
We used the [QRD1113](http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/fairchild-semiconductor/QRD1113/QRD1113-ND/402766) for our white line sensors.

#### Ultrasonic
We used [HC-SR04](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13959) for our range sensors. The came with an easy to use [library](http://tutorial.cytron.com.my/2012/10/11/testing-ultrasonic-ranging-module-sn-hc-sr04/) that converted sensor readings directly into cm that made it easy to build logic around.
